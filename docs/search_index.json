[["index.html", "Workflows for processing microbial amplicon sequences Chapter 1 About this GitBook", " Workflows for processing microbial amplicon sequences Christian Krohn, PhD, RMIT University 2022-07-26 Chapter 1 About this GitBook This GitBook contains workflows for students who want to get started with sequencing microbial amplicons on a Miseq instrument and then process and analyse ASV-based data. It is a compilation of workflows that I have gotten accustomed to during my PhD at La Trobe University with help of many amazing students and colleagues over the years. But it is by no means comprehensive. One of the biggest hurdles for students that embark on sequencing environmental DNA for the first time, is the effort that is required to understand the various coding languages, file types and formats, packages or platforms that are involved (think Unix, Linux, Slurm, Qiime, R, RMarkdown, python, conda, ggplot, docker, GitHub, data instances…) before they even can start looking at exploring the data for biological meaning and producing publishable output. For example, this GitBook is made in Rstudio, using the rmarkdown markup language, rendered using the bookdown package, and hosted on GitHub. It took me at least five years before I was ready to create and host this content for students. And even then I needed this awesome Bookdown template from Dr. Caspar van Lissa to get started with Bookdown. So it is really helpful to have something to start with. It was not easy to get over the initial hurdles for me too, so I thought I’d try to compile my workflows. This may help students to get a head start but also helps to scrutinise my approach in the hope that others can point me to better ways of doing things. Browse to your level Everyone is at a different level in the journey to exploring microbial diversity. Some have absolutely no idea where to start and others have created their first phylogentic trees with ggtree or similar. The most important prerequisites are patience and persistence… :). Just explore the different chapters and see where it takes you. In fact you will be amazed how much you can achieve with mininal coding knowledge. Get in touch We work at the Andy Ball lab, RMIT University, Bundoora, Melbourne. Email me or comment on the discussion section of the GitHub repository for this GitBook. You will need to get a GitHub account to join the discussion. Its free. "],["gettingstarted.html", "Chapter 2 Getting started 2.1 General requirements 2.2 A note on rarefying (normalising) 2.3 Workflows from other lab groups", " Chapter 2 Getting started Prerequisites will be listed in each sub chapter separately. Following a few general comments: 2.1 General requirements 2.1.1 Access to computational resources To process data you will need a personal computer or online computational resources with sufficient number of CPUs, working memory and storage. If you want to run most of the processing on a personal computer then I’d recommend a minimum of 4 CPUs, 16 Gb RAM and 500 Gb storage. However, please note that some alignment tasks require more RAM, hence some of the steps (e.g. taxonomic classifications) may require a more powerful resource. The advantage of using a personal computer is that you can frequently update the latest packages without relying on a university administrator to do that for you. Furthermore, with a personal computer you wont need to share with others, making it easier to run the packages without a workload manager. Some university may provide their own access to a high performance computer (HPC) for staff and students and likely have certain packages pre-installed. In such cases a batch workload manger such as Slurm may be used, to manage multiple users trying to run computationally heavy jobs. This works fine too but its a bit of a hassle and I would use such an HPC only if really necessary, i.e. smaller jobs on my personal computer and bigger jobs on the HPC. I am not aware that RMIT University offers that type of service yet. In Australia there is also the ARDC Nectar Research Cloud, which provides free resources to Universities. This is basically like providing access to an online Linux computer with complete freedom to install any packages as if it was your own. If you are a student you can create a trial account with your student email address (Using your ID only; without the student.edu.au) and check out how it all works, albeit with limited resources. The Nectar service also provides tuturials for starters. However, to get serious with Nectar, you have to request more resources, which is a fairly straight-forward process. Check out the eligibilities and chat to your supervisor if you are interested. There are also commercial options, which probably offer very similar type of services to Nectar. In addition, there is the awesome Galaxy Australia platform, which is an open web-based resource that also contains many tutorials and workflows specific to bioinformatics. Definitely worth checking that out too. This workbook will be based on using the Nectar Research cloud. 2.1.2 File storage Working with sequencing data may require you do handle large amounts of data. From experience, a run of a 600µl pool (6-10pM) of amplicons in 2x301 Miseq cycles may produce around 10-20 Gb of FASTQ files. Much more can be expected for NextSeq runs or for long-read sequencing. Once a Miseq run has finished it is typically available to download from the Illumina Basespace account. After a few runs, the data can accumulate quickly. Hence, persistent storage space is required. As long as you have the Basespace account you can keep a copy of the FASTQ file online. However, Basespace may delete your data if the account has been inactive for more than 6 months. Alternatively, data can be upload onto a public repository for persistent storage, such as the Sequence Reads Archives. If you have access to a research cloud or commercial computational resources then you may store data on those. Personally, I prefer a 1TB solid state harddrive. 2.1.3 Command Line Many of the tools used are managed through command line. Cloud servers are also accessed through command line. That means there is no graphical user interphase and all commands, including installation and running of packages are done through lines of codes on a simple window interphase. This window is called Terminal (Mac, Linux) or Command Prompt application (Windows). There are lots of online sources to help you get started with command line. One example here: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-guide-to-using-command-line-terminal-96815b97b955 2.1.4 Data storage browser To upload, download, move, rename files on any cloud computer or high performance computer (HPC) at your institution, you will also require a cloud storage browser, such as Cyberduck (Mac) or PuTTY (Windows). 2.1.5 R and R studio R has become an essential research language. If you want to progress in research it is almost inevitable for you to learn. Just do it. :). Perhaps start here if you dont know where else to start: https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/. It lists some great step-by-step tutorials on how to install R and Rstudio and then explains the basics. If you are like me, then you simply copy and paste code from other sites and see what happens. This book should provide you with the required information to enable you to follow the workflows. In case you get stuck, you can either chat to me directly or write on the GitHub Discussion Page for this GitBook (chrismitbiz/ABlab-workflows/discussions/). At the same time you will want to do short courses (eg. from edX Data Science: R Basics) that delve a little deeper into different data structures such as data frames, matrices, lists and the syntax to arrange stuff. Over time you understand what different lines of code mean and can trouble shoot when things don’t work. And things often don’t work. You will get used to troubleshooting code :). 2.1.6 Environment managers Package and environment managers are extremely useful for your workflows. They help to install and run software packages such as qiime2, into individual ‘environments’ independent of your operating system. The environment manager is installed once and from there you use it to install individual packages. The most commonly used environment manager is Conda. Learn more about it here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html Conda can be installed by either installing Anaconda or Miniconda. Boths works the same way. Anaconda requires 5 Gb of discspace and installs everything you can possibly need, while Miniconda is just the raw bones and lets you install things one by one. Most of the commands to manage environments are done in command line using a terminal. There is also a graphical installer that makes handling the environments a little more visual. That would be my go to. Learn more here: www.anaconda.com. Once conda installed you can always check what environments are installed with the command conda env list. In my case the output looks like this: There are several other environment managers. We are also using Docker in our work but the learning curve is a bit steeper so we wont get into it here. 2.1.7 Explore the help functions Packages such as qiime2 have great resources to help you understand how to run any of the available commands. For example if you dont know what input parameters are available for the qiime command qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn, you can simply enter this command into your Terminal (with the qiime environment activated, if it is installed with Conda) and add a --help at the end: qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn --help. Or you just want to know what other commands qiime has in its repertoire, you can run qiime --help. For example, this conda activate qiime2-2022.2 qiime --help Gives Within R studio you can access the documentation of individual packages by searching for package or function names in the help windows. For example looking for phyloseq in the Help window gives this: 2.1.8 GitHub account This GitBook, including all its files, is hosted on one of my GitHub repositories (https://github.com/chrismitbiz/ABlab-workflows). If you have any comments you can ask a question on the Discussion Page of this repository. You require a GitHub account to do that. It is free. 2.2 A note on rarefying (normalising) Various data normalisation methods exist and opinions on their applicability diverge. Example of normalisation methods: Rarefying data Transformation into relative abundances Transformation into centered log-ratios Cumulative Sum Scaling (CSS) Upper Quantile (UQ) edgeR-trimmed mean of M values (TMM) DESeq-variance stabilizing transformation (VS) There are others. Check out this link to learn more about the different types of normalisation methods: MicrobiomeAnalyst: FAQs, What are the various normalization methods and which method should I choose?. Rarefying data is one of the more contested methods. We acknowledge that rarefying data (i.e. the random subsampling of abundances to usually the smallest library size) results in loss of data and statistical power and is thus not recommended for differential abundance analyses. Check out this well cited paper here to learn why: Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data Is Inadmissible (McMurdie and Holmes (2014)). However, rarefying still “outperformed all the other normalization methods for producing accurate BC (Bray-Curtis) dissimilarities and subsequent PCoAs and PERMANOVAs.” Paper here: Methods for normalizing microbiome data: An ecological perspective (McKnight et al. (2019)). For our workflows we may rarefy data before creating alpha diversity indices (Shannon, Simpsons etc), beta diversity indices (Bray-Curtis dissimilarities). Other types of normalisation methods should be considered for differential abundance analyses. My preference is to use centred-log ratios (Aitchison distances). The compositional approach and centred log-ratios are further discussed in the paper Microbiome Datasets Are Compositional: And This Is Not Optional (Gloor et al. (2017)). This type of transformation requires the removal of some of the rare ASVs to remove as many zeros from the abundance table as reasonable. 2.3 Workflows from other lab groups The following review “should serve as a starting point for considering what options are available”: Analysing microbial community composition through amplicon sequencing: from sampling to hypothesis testing (Hugerth and Andersson (2017)). Furthermore, searching for “amplicon-sequencing” under “Topics” on GitHub gave 37 results. nf-core/ampliseq On the top of that list is the nf-core/ampliseq pipeline developed by the nf-core community. It is based on a software called Nextflow which allows to put different processes into a pipeline. This is great for doing things a little more reproducible but it requires you to be fairly knowledgeable with Linux, container software, config files etc.. Not great to learn stuff for beginners. Tools-Microbiome-Analysis Tools-Microbiome-Analysis is a websites containing a comprehensive list of R packages and, more importantly, tutorials related to analysis of microbial amplicons and ecology. Really good reference to go back to every now and then. Highly recommended. grimmlab/MicrobiomeBestPracticeReview Essential paper to read (Current challenges and best-practice protocols for microbiome analysis, 2021 (Bharti and Grimm (2021))) and a great workflow resource on GitHub. Essential read. The Grimm lab in Munich published this paper as well as developed a python and R-based workflow that assists with the recommended best practices (amplicon as well as metagenomic workflows). KasperSkytte/ampvis2 Ampviz2 is an R-package to visualise and analyse 16S rRNA amplicon data. It is always more convenient to have packages that have the details and optics worked out for you. Like phyloseq, the ampviz2 package combines different tables from data (E.g. otu table, taxonomic table, phylogenetic tree, sample data etc) and then provides different functions to apply to that combined object to visualise the data. References "],["miseq-library-preps.html", "Chapter 3 Miseq library preps 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Workflow", " Chapter 3 Miseq library preps 3.1 Introduction Some info on getting your run ready In our lab we usually prepare a 6-10 pM pool of libraries following the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol from Illumina with 10-30% Phix. Download it, study it and refer to it throughout your labwork. This protocol is not limited to 16S amplicons. You can use it for fungal (e.g. ITS) amplicons too. In the last section there are also valuable tips for pre‐PCR and post‐PCR lab procedures. There is also some additional Illumina guidance here: https://sapac.support.illumina.com/downloads/16s_metagenomic_sequencing_library_preparation.html 3.1.1 Overview The protocol encompasses the following steps (copied out of the protocol): Please note that only one amplicon target should be sequenced in each run. That means it is not recommended to sequence for example two different 16S amplicons or one 16S amplicon plus an ITS amplicon. Sequencing different amplicon lengths will result in reduced quality as the the Miseq flowcell will preferentially cluster shorter fragments. However, it is not impossible. We have tried to run four different amplicons on one flowcell before, although with mixed results. Labwork may take four weeks from DNA extraction to Miseq loading. Double that if you have not done it before. You probably realised that there is quite a bit of labwork required before you finally get FASTQ files and subsequent ASV/taxonomy tables to analyse - the ultimate goal here. The more samples are planned to be included into the pool, the more work and consumables are needed. Illumina recommends no more than 96 samples on one flowcell to get enough depths (i.e. &gt; 100,000 reads per sample). But we have sequenced around 196 samples on one flowcell before, which captured sufficient reads and diversity. This depends on how much detail and rare taxa you want to capture. The less samples you include, the more data and depth for each sample. Also note that you will require over 20 boxes of tips (mostly 200 µl) for each 96-well plate, so plan your consumables ahead of time. Most of the tips will be used for the PCR clean ups. After all steps in the above protocol are completed, the Miseq will be loaded with a 600 µl pool, followed by 56 hours of run-time for 2x301 cycles before FASTQ files are available for download from BaseSpace. Throughout the 56 hours run you can check how things are tracking either on the BaseSpace website or the BaseSpace phone app. Understanding different QC metrics will help identifying potential problems with the pool or the instrument. It is important to note that this is a bit of a nerve-wrecking moment in the process, as it remains unclear until the metrics come through after around the 21st cycle, whether or not the run will be successful. 3.2 Workflow 3.2.1 DNA extraction “DNA extracts” We commonly extract DNA from soils or from wastewater sludges using the DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit (Qiagen) for both, soil and sludge. It results in high quality DNA and includes a bead beating step to make sure the gram positive cells are sufficiently broken up. Although, I don’t have evidence for that. In fact, please let us know on the GitHub Discussion Page for this GitBook if you have any comments on that as we are always looking for ways to improve things. Soil For soils, the protocol of the extraction kit is followed, weighing in 0.25 g of soil and making sure to record the exact weights used. Also make sure to measure the water content of the soil to be able to report DNA concentrations per dry weight of soil. Sludge For DNA extraction of sludge, 0.5 ml is added into an empty 1.7 ml extraction tube (without extraction beads), then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes before removing the supernatent. Extraction beads are then added and the Powersoil protocol followed. Measure Total Solids (TS) of the sludge to report DNA concentrations per gram of TS. 3.2.2 DNA quality and concentration Once you have extracted DNA it is necessary to confirm its quality and concentration. Quality is assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer. You are aiming for 260/280 Ratio of 1.8 and a 260/230 Ratio of 2-2.2. This is explained in the T042‐TECHNICAL BULLETIN. The Nanopore also estimates DNA concentrations but it is not recommended to use these concentrations measurements to normalise DNA. It is more accurate and consistent with a Qubit Fluorometer. DNA concentrations are best measured using fluorescent dye-based methods such as the Qubit Fluorometer. It is easist to use the ‘1X’ assays such as the Qubit 1X dsDNA BR Assay Kit or the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit Broad range (BR) Kit for quantifying extracted environmental DNA and afte the 2nd stage PCR. High Sensitivity (HS) Kit for quantifying the pool at the end. “The ready-mix working solution for Qubit, which includes dye and buffer. No preparation/premixing required.” 3.2.3 DNA normalisation The next step is to normalise all DNA extracts to 5 ng/µl. Dilute DNA to equal concentrations, either in a fresh batch of PCR-grade 10mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5) or in PCR-grade water Set a pre-define DNA volume, say 2µl for all extracts, and add Tris or water as calculated with \\[ C_1V_1 = V_2 C_2 \\] 3.2.4 First and second PCR - Amplicon PCR and Indexing PCR Follow the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation Guide. Include a negative control and sequence that as well. This allows you to assess background and cross contamination. The whole workflow is best done in 96-well plates, using multi-channel pipettes to avoid indexing mistakes across wells. Sample list and plate layout Ensure that all sample IDs, plate-layout and each unique Illumina index carefully planned and printed out before you start your PCRs. Perhaps, stick the layout onto the Bio-safety cabinet where you do most of the pipetting and keep checking you are on the right well and sample. Label all plates even if you discard them afterwards. Labwork can be stressful and you need to trace all your steps across each well of the plate because otherwise you risk that you have indexed the wrong samples and it will become impossible to know which sample you have sequenced. Primers Any primers you order for the Miseq will have to include the Illumina overhang adapter. The sequence of the overhang adapter is added in front of the gene-specific primer sequences. There are two overhang adapters; one for the forward primers and one for the reverse primer. Check out the relevant information on primers from page 3 the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation Guide. Clean-ups It is worth doing the clean-ups in a separate deep-well plate (“MIDI” plate, see consumables below) to avoid any blow-out of dried beads at the end of the clean-up. This process is explained in the above mentioned guide too. Tip: Handle the beads extremely carefully after the ethanol has dried. They blow out easily. Index Kits The index kits are expensive. Try to handle them with care and replace lids with the provided replacement lids, after every use. Multipipettes are absolutely essential to avoid loosing track on indexes used across the different wells on the plate. The use of the Illumina Plate Fixture comes in handy (see consumables below). Amplicon QC After the indexing-PCR products are cleaned it is recommended to run a gel on all samples to confirm that amplification was successful with enough DNA present and that it is the correct amplicon length. It also helps to identify any primer dimers, which may have to be cleaned out. If you have access to a Tapestation or a Bioanalyzer in your lab, perhaps run a random subset of the indexed samples on one of these instruments, just to accurately confirm the average length of the amplicon. This average basepair length of the amplicon is important, as it is the basis for normalising your DNA to nM. In any case, after the index samples are normalised and pooled, it is highly recommended to run the pool on a Bioanalyser too. Otherwise it is too much guesswork in getting the concentrations right. This is further explained below. Repeat any samples that failed, i.e. that do not show any bands, and ensure you use the same indices. 3.2.5 Normalisation of indexed amplicons After you finished all PCR work it is time to do another round of Qubitting and normalisation of all samples into a new 96-well plate. The final pool should be 4 nM but we prefer to normalise DNA to a higher concentration first, say 10 nM, then pool and then dilute the pool to 4 nM afterwards. We are using a very handy excel sheet, which was kindly developed and provided by Sarah Knowler at La Trobe University to prepare and assist in normalisations, converting from ng/µl to nM using the formula: \\[ concentrations~(ng/µl) \\over 660 g/mol~x~average~library~size\\] Contact us if you would like to get a copy of this very handy library preparation excel sheet. Some more information here: https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/system_documentation/miseq/miseq-denature-dilute-libraries-guide-15039740-10.pdf. There’s also a pooling calculator here https://support.illumina.com/help/pooling-calculator/pooling-calculator.htm which may be helpful with your calculations. 3.2.6 Pooling Pipette equal volumes of the normalised DNA into one 1.5 ml tube. Measure its concentration using the High Sensitivity (HS) Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Assuming the pool was created wtih normalised concentration that are higher than 4 nM, then you will need to dilute the pool down to 4nM. In order to do so you will need to accurately measure the average basepair length of your pool. Do not rely on the ladder on a gel. Always get an accurate read. See next point. Measure the average base pair lengths of the pool with a Bioanalyzer or Tapestation. Use at least three replicates. The average basepair length is then used to calculate the final concentration required in ng/µl to get a 4 nM pool. Dilute the pool to the concentration in ng/µl that reflect 4 nM. 3.2.7 Denaturing of pool and loading of the Miseq Now you are almost ready load the Miseq. The last steps are done right before you plan to load the instrument. First the pool DNA needs to be denatured, mixed with PhiX and then diluted further to your preferred loading concentration (6 - 10 pM). The final concentrations impact on cluster densities. That means you get more data with higher concentrations but that is at the expense of potential errors during sequencing at high cluster densities. I am still not quite sure what the ideal concentration is. Please let me know if you know more. The key for the final steps are that.. ..the reagent cartridge is properly thawed. Perhaps thaw in fridge 3 hours before starting the denaturing steps. Then put into icy water to ensure final and even thawing across the cartridge. Mix cartrige well at the end and ensure that no bubbles are visible before loading. .. the 0.2 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is made fresh with biological grade NaOH. For example use the BioUltra, for molecular biology, 10 M NaOH in H2O from Sigma Aldrich to make a 0.2 N solution (N = Normality but it is equal to Molarity here because there is only one OH in NaOH). I have used analytical-grade NaOH pellets as well, which worked but the RNAse free solutions are safer in terms of inhibitors etc.. ..that the pool is cooled down immediately in ice or icy water right after the 2 minutes in the 96 degrees C heatblock and pretty much immediately loaded into the Miseq. The Miseq has to be prepped beforehand (I.e. maintenance wash and sample sheet loaded). a sample sheet (or so-called manifest file) is created beforehand using the Illumina Experiment Manager Software. This software assist in producing a .csv file that is then loaded into the Miseq instrument via a USB and ensures that the indexes you have used are linked to the relevant samples in your pool. Basically a list of sample IDs and index IDs. An example of a sample sheet from one of our runs is shown below. IMPORTANT: Make sure to specify the Workflow as GenerateFastQ. you have a Illumina BaseSpace account. “Example of a manifest file” 3.2.8 Consumables All consumables and equipment required for the 16S Miseq library prep protocol are available from page 21 of the above mentioned 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation Guide. The magnetic stand for 96-well plates and the TruSeq Index Plate Fixture Kit are essential. Here is what we typically include into our purchasing list.

We are using Qiime2. Please also refer to the extensive documentation and tutorials available at https://qiime2.org. You can learn almost everything there. 4.1.1 Prerequisites and required files FASTQ files available to download on BaseSpace. Two for each sample. One for read 1 (R1) and another for read 2 (R2). For example, PT-01_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz and PT-01_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz contains all sequences for sample PT-01. Personal computer or cloud computational resources with &gt; 4 CPUS, &gt; 16 RAM, &gt; 100 GB storage recommended. Cloud storage browser installed (example Cyberduck or PuTTYm see Chapter 2). Qiime2 installed. Always use the latest version. All required files in correct format and file extension (see below). The BaseSpace Downloader software (available on the BaseSpace page. You will be prompted to download once you go to your files). Qiimeimportmanifest.tsv - A tab separated file with three columns where the first column is the sample ID (The exact same ID that was used in the manifest file for loading the Miseq). The second and third columns are the absolute paths to the forward and reverse FASTQ files, respectively. If you are working on a cloud computer then the FASTQ files should be uploaded to that, and the path needs to contain the full path to the relevant folder, including the full name of the file itself. If you process those files on your local drive then the paths need to change to your local folder containing the FASTQ files. In the below example table, the files are located on a Linux cloud computer (Nectar Research Cloud). It might take some time to compile the import manifest. Each file path has to exact. However, in case you made a mistake in the file names etc, Qiime is generally pretty good at reporting where the error occured.

Not sure how else to easily build the .tsv file. scriptfile.txt - A text file that contains your qiime2 scripts. Example below. Code is compiled here and then only the file itself is executed to run any commands in that text. The hash (#) in front of any line of code stops it from being executed. That means all code is normally ‘hashed’. If one wants to run the code the lines are ‘un-hashed’ and the text file is executed in the command line to run the ‘un-hashed’ code. On the Linux cloud computer the command would be: sh scriptfile.txt. Note that a script file is meant to make life easy and the process replicable. But you could run each of the processes directly by adding the commands into the terminal without a script file. “Example of a scriptfile.txt” Briefly on script files for cloud-based high performance computers (HPC) that are using Slurm to manage multiple user runs. If the HPC at your institution is using Slurm, then the script file has to be called with sbatch scriptfile.txt. The script files for HPCs using slurm contains a header that determins the allocations (number of CPUs, RAM etc..) for your task. The first lines of the .txt file typically look similar to this: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=6 #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=6000 #SBATCH --time=24:00:00 #SBATCH --partition=compute #SBATCH --job-name=Q_fun Commands, such as this: echo &quot;Starting at: $(date)&quot; echo &quot;Finished at: $(date)&quot; .. are less important but help to report the start and end times of the executed commands from beginning (where the echo command is placed at the beginning of the script) to end (echo… placed at the end of the script) into the Terminal Windows. They dont affect the qiime commands in any way. Slurm and sbatch are not needed if you manage your own computer or your ‘own’ cloud computer. In the example below we are using a Linux cloud computer, provided by the Nectar Research Cloud so we dont need Slurm. 4.2 Workflow 4.2.1 Download FASTQ files In this example, Fastq files were produced from sequencing 16SrRNA marker genes on an Illumina Miseq instrument. If you ran your own library on your own BaseSpace account, the files should be available to download from that BaseSpace account. If the run was created by another user, that person can invite you to the run, which gives you access to download the files too. Log in to BaseSpace and into your project. Go to files, run and download FastQ. You will be asked to install a downloader software. Follow instructions accordingly. The FASTQ files will come in separate folders for each sample. It is necessary to move all files into just ONE folder. That folder will then be used to import the sequences into a qiime object (described below). 4.2.2 Paired end manifest import (Step 1) Go to the folder that contains all the FASTQ files (all files in one folder). I.e. in Unix/Linux use cd path/to/folder/ to navigate to it. The scriptfile.txt should also be located here. The following qiime command that will look for the files and then create a qiime object using the sequences found in each FASTQ file. The --output-path instructs qiime where to place and how to name the output file, here demux-paired-end.qza is placed into the same directory. Remove any # in front of your code (already removed in the below example) and execute the scriptfile.txt with sh scriptfile.txt (or sbatch scriptfile.txt in case you are using Slurm). qiime tools import --type &#39;SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]&#39; \\ --input-path Qiimeimportmanifest.tsv \\ --output-path demux-paired-end.qza \\ --input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33V2 4.2.3 Cutadapt (Step 2) If all goes well you should now have a demux-paired-end.qza file in the same directory as your FASTQ files , which contains all your sequences. You could move demux-paired-end.qza to another folder and continue all other steps there if you wish. The FASTQ files are not needed anymore. Dont forget to move your script file to where it is most convenient for executing the commands. If you moved the demux-paired-end.qza to another folder it is probably easiest to also move the script file that the same directory (or create a second script file containing the remaining commands). Go to the folder containing demux-paired-end.qza and use cutadapt to trim out the primer sequences. Unhash relevant lines in your script file, which should be located in the same folder. Run sh scriptfile.txt. In this example we used the V4 primers. Change primer sequence to the exact primers that you used in the amplicon PCR. qiime cutadapt trim-paired \\ --i-demultiplexed-sequences demux-paired-end.qza \\ --p-front-f GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA \\ --p-front-r GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT \\ --o-trimmed-sequences trimmed_demux-paired-end.qza 4.2.4 Read quality assessment Visualise the output with a .qzv file The .qza files can be visualised by ‘converting’ them into .qzv files. Here we take the trimmed_demux-paired-end.qza and create a trimmed_demux-paired-end.qzv. NOTE: View any .qzv file on https://view.qiime2.org. Drag and drop the qzv file into the browser window and inspect the results. qiime demux summarize \\ --i-data trimmed_demux-paired-end.qza \\ --o-visualization trimmed_demux-paired-end.qzv Go to https://view.qiime2.org and drag and drop to visualise your .qzv file in the browser. Now click on the ‘Interactive Quality Plot’ tab. You will see exactly that: Interactive Quality plots that look like this: Note the total number of sequences. You want to retain a high percentage of these after quality filtering with DADA2. “Example of a demux.qzv visualisation” STOP HERE. Inspect the visualisation and decide on location and maximum expected error. From the output decide where to truncate the forward and reverse reads with p-trunc-len-f, p-trunc-len-r,--p-max-ee-f and --p-max-ee-r in DADA2 below. It can take some trial and error to get these setting right. We are using a docker-based package called FIGARO to help us estimate those parameters (Not shown here). But essentially you want to capture high quality reads and be confident about the Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV), while also capture sufficent depth of ASVs and reads without unnecessarily filtering out too much. In the below example, we have trimmed the forward reads at 272 base pairs with a maximum expected error (max-ee) of 2 (which is the default) and the reverse reads at 151 with a max-ee of 3. I think it is o.k. to relax the max-ee for the reverse reads (which are ALWAYS lower in quality) as I feel more confident about the fact that the reverse reads are paired with the forward reads. Pairing in itself provides increased confidence that the reads do in fact represent a biological relevant sequence. As always please comment on our GitHub discussion page if you have any suggestions here. Thanks! A minimum overlap between the forward and reverse primer of 20 base pairs is recommended. To overlap can be calculated as following: length forward read + length reverse read - length amplicon - truncated basepairs forward read - truncated basepairs reverse reads = overlap So, for example, if we picked --p-trunc-len-f 272 and --p-trunc-len-r 151, we get \\[301 + 301 - 292 - 29 - 150 = 131~bp~overlap\\] In cases where the quality of the reverse reads is very poor, or the amplicon is too long for pairing to work, it is also acceptable to import, trim and denoise only the forward reads. The V4 primer of this example, is nice and short at 292 basepairs, so is great for pairing even at lower reverse-read qualities. 4.2.5 Denoise paired end sequences with dada2 (Step 3) Once the trimming and max-ee parameters are decided, it is time to run the DADA2 function. This may take a while, depending on total number of samples. The output will be a feature_table.qza and sample_rep_seqs.qza, containing the ASV abundances and their sequences respectively. qiime dada2 denoise-paired \\ --i-demultiplexed-seqs trimmed_demux-paired-end.qza \\ --o-table feature_table.qza \\ --o-representative-sequences sample_rep_seqs.qza \\ --p-trim-left-f 0 --p-trim-left-r 0 \\ --p-trunc-len-f 271 \\ --p-trunc-len-r 151 \\ --p-max-ee-f 2 \\ --p-max-ee-r 3 \\ --output-dir dada2 \\ --verbose Summarise and visualise the ASV abundances (feature_table.qza) in a .qzv file. qiime feature-table summarize \\ --i-table feature_table.qza \\ --o-visualization feature_table.qzv \\ --m-sample-metadata-file samplesheet.tsv Note: Look at the feature_table.qzv and record median reads per sample. Compare the total frequency after denoising with the total sequence count from the trimmed_demux-paired-end.qza. You hope to retain a high percentage of total sequences after denoising with DADA2. It is prudent to report that percentage in your methods. “feature_table.qzv output” 4.2.6 Taxonomic classifier and assignment (Step 4) The next step is to assign taxonomies to the sequences in the denoised sample sequences. Here, we use a pre-trained classifier that is based on the Silva database. This pre-trained classifier is available on the data resource page of Qiime (Most current link at the time of writing: https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.2/data-resources). However, in case you used a different primer you would have to create the classifier yourself. Again there is great resource avaiable on https://docs.qiime2.org. The process is fairly straight forward but takes computational time. Briefly, extract reference reads from a database (i.e. Silva here) based on the primers used. Then use those extracted sequences and fit or train them onto a taxonomy. Basically, predict which amplicon sequence should be what phylym/class/order/family/genus etc…. This trained file becomes a ‘classifier’ that is used to assign taxonmies on your sequences. Here we have a pre-trained classifier, silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza: The output is a file called taxonomy_silva.qza and taxonomy_silva.qzv in this case. qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn \\ --i-classifier silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza \\ --p-reads-per-batch 10000 \\ --i-reads sample_rep_seqs.qza \\ --o-classification taxonomy_silva.qza \\ --quiet # Then summarise and visualise the output into a .qza file qiime metadata tabulate \\ --m-input-file taxonomy_silva.qza \\ --o-visualization taxonomy_silva.qzv 4.2.7 Build phylogenetic tree (Step 5) The next step is not essential but really good to have. Creating a phylogenetic tree from the amplicon sequences. In this case we are using the insertion tree method. See https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/q2-fragment-insertion/16/ for more information in this method. As not all ASVs will be inserted we will filter the feature_table.qza again to keep only those ASVs that are in the tree. You will need the reference file from silva or greengenes. In this case we are using sepp-refs-silva-128.qza. qiime fragment-insertion sepp \\ --i-representative-sequences sample_rep_seqs.qza \\ --i-reference-database sepp-refs-silva-128.qza \\ --o-tree insertion-tree.qza \\ --o-placements insertion-placements.qza qiime fragment-insertion filter-features \\ --i-table feature_table.qza \\ --i-tree insertion-tree.qza \\ --o-filtered-table feature_table_insertiontreefiltered.qza \\ --o-removed-table removed_features.qza Done! Everything else including further quality filtering happens with phyloseq in R where we will import the following files: feature_table_insertiontreefiltered.qza, taxonomy_silva.qza and insertion-tree.qza. This will be covered in the next chapter. 4.2.8 All steps combined Copy and paste this into your script file if needed. # Manifest Import qiime tools import --type &#39;SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]&#39; \\ --input-path Qiimeimportmanifest.tsv \\ --output-path demux-paired-end.qza \\ --input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33V2 # Cutadapt qiime cutadapt trim-paired \\ --i-demultiplexed-sequences demux-paired-end.qza \\ --p-front-f GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA \\ --p-front-r GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT \\ --o-trimmed-sequences trimmed_demux-paired-end.qza qiime demux summarize \\ --i-data trimmed_demux-paired-end.qza \\ --o-visualization trimmed_demux-paired-end.qzv # Denoise qiime dada2 denoise-paired \\ --i-demultiplexed-seqs trimmed_demux-paired-end.qza \\ --o-table feature_table.qza \\ --o-representative-sequences sample_rep_seqs.qza \\ --p-trim-left-f 0 --p-trim-left-r 0 \\ --p-trunc-len-f 271 \\ --p-trunc-len-r 151 \\ --p-max-ee-f 2 \\ --p-max-ee-r 3 \\ --output-dir dada2 \\ --verbose qiime feature-table summarize \\ --i-table feature_table.qza \\ --o-visualization feature_table.qzv \\ --m-sample-metadata-file samplesheet.tsv # Taxonomic assignment qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn \\ --i-classifier silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza \\ --p-reads-per-batch 10000 \\ --i-reads sample_rep_seqs.qza \\ --o-classification taxonomy_silva.qza \\ --quiet # Phylogenetic tree qiime fragment-insertion sepp \\ --i-representative-sequences sample_rep_seqs.qza \\ --i-reference-database sepp-refs-silva-128.qza \\ --o-tree insertion-tree.qza \\ --o-placements insertion-placements.qza # Final filtering qiime fragment-insertion filter-features \\ --i-table feature_table.qza \\ --i-tree insertion-tree.qza \\ --o-filtered-table feature_table_insertiontreefiltered.qza \\ --o-removed-table removed_features.qza Qiime2 reference: Bolyen E, Rideout JR, Dillon MR, Bokulich NA, Abnet CC, Al-Ghalith GA, Alexander H, Alm EJ, Arumugam M, Asnicar F, Bai Y, Bisanz JE, Bittinger K, Brejnrod A, Brislawn CJ, Brown CT, Callahan BJ, Caraballo-Rodríguez AM, Chase J, Cope EK, Da Silva R, Diener C, Dorrestein PC, Douglas GM, Durall DM, Duvallet C, Edwardson CF, Ernst M, Estaki M, Fouquier J, Gauglitz JM, Gibbons SM, Gibson DL, Gonzalez A, Gorlick K, Guo J, Hillmann B, Holmes S, Holste H, Huttenhower C, Huttley GA, Janssen S, Jarmusch AK, Jiang L, Kaehler BD, Kang KB, Keefe CR, Keim P, Kelley ST, Knights D, Koester I, Kosciolek T, Kreps J, Langille MGI, Lee J, Ley R, Liu YX, Loftfield E, Lozupone C, Maher M, Marotz C, Martin BD, McDonald D, McIver LJ, Melnik AV, Metcalf JL, Morgan SC, Morton JT, Naimey AT, Navas-Molina JA, Nothias LF, Orchanian SB, Pearson T, Peoples SL, Petras D, Preuss ML, Pruesse E, Rasmussen LB, Rivers A, Robeson MS, Rosenthal P, Segata N, Shaffer M, Shiffer A, Sinha R, Song SJ, Spear JR, Swafford AD, Thompson LR, Torres PJ, Trinh P, Tripathi A, Turnbaugh PJ, Ul-Hasan S, van der Hooft JJJ, Vargas F, Vázquez-Baeza Y, Vogtmann E, von Hippel M, Walters W, Wan Y, Wang M, Warren J, Weber KC, Williamson CHD, Willis AD, Xu ZZ, Zaneveld JR, Zhang Y, Zhu Q, Knight R, and Caporaso JG. 2019.

For this exercise we will us publicly available FastQ files that were generated by a research group in Denmark. The files are available in the Sequence Read Archives (SRA) under accession number PRJNA645373. Reference: [1] C. Jiang, S.J. McIlroy, R. Qi, F. Petriglieri, E. Yashiro, Z. Kondrotaite, P.H. Nielsen, Identification of microorganisms responsible for foam formation in mesophilic anaerobic digesters treating surplus activated sludge, Water Res. 191 (2021) 116779. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116779. Sample IDs You decide on the samplesIDs before you start your library prep and sequencing. For this chapter we use a different dataset to the previous chatper and its sampleIDs are longer, e.g. “SRR12204258” and “SRR12204269”, compared to “PT-01”, “PT-02” in the previous chapter. It does not matter how you label each of your indexed samples as long as the IDs are unique. And each unique sample ID in the samplesheet.csv needs to match the sample IDs of the feature_table.qza. You may recall those IDs originate from your Miseq run and are the same sample IDs that are used on the loading manifest file to prepare the run. They subsequently are part of the FastQ filenames and flow through into any relevant Qiime2 data. If a sample ID does not match or if there is a different number of samples between these two input files, then phyloseq will complain. Here the first three Sample IDs (“SRR12204258” and “SRR12204269” etc..) in the ASV table from this data set.: ASV IDs The same principle applies to each ID of the ASVs. The ASVs IDs have to match between the feature_table.qza and the taxonomy_silva.qza. Following the first three ASV IDs (Feature ID) and related taxon assignments in taxonomy_silva.qza of this dataset: NOTE: After the denoising, taxonomic classification and tree alignments in Qiime2, I prefer to do all subsequent analysis in R. However, it is also possible to do much of the diversity analysis in Qiime2. In fact, some interesting plug-ins and functions in Qiime2 are not available as packages in R, hence for some specific tasks you may need to keep using Qiime2. It is up to the goals and preferences of the investigator. Now let’s work in R! Required files samplesheet.tsv - same file that was used in the visualisation steps in Qiime2 feature_table.qza - if you created a phylogenetic tree from the sequences as described in the previous chapter then the ASVs in the feature table were filtered to match the ASVs in the tree. Hence the files was named featuretable-insertiontree-filtered.qza to differentiate it. taxonomy_silva.qza insertion-tree.qza 5.2 Workflow 5.2.1 Packages First install the required packages. Some packages are stored on ‘remote’ repositories such as GitHub, hence before you can install them you need helper packages such as remotes. Other packages, such as phyloseq are managed by BioConductor project. They provide their own package manager package for R called BiocManager, which helps to install from the same release. Learn more about phyloseq here: https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/ Both, remotes and BiocManager are already installed in the below example. Once the packages are installed, load them into your working space. # install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) # if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) # install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) # remotes::install_github(&quot;jbisanz/qiime2R&quot;) # BiocManager::install(&quot;phyloseq&quot;) library(qiime2R) # to import qiime.qza into an R object library(phyloseq) # To combine all relevant data objects into one object for easy data management library(tidyverse) # Compilation of packages for data management library(stringr) # to change some of the strings in taxonomic names library(vegan) # A commonly used package for numerical ecology 5.2.2 Import qiime-files and create a phyloseq object Now that packages are loaded we can import the Qiime2 .qza and the .tsv files. The aim is to import everything as R objects, which are then combined into one phyloseq object. Once we have a phyloseq object, any filtering and visualisations can be run from the one object. In the previous chapter, we used a samplesheet.tsv to visualise and summarise the feature_table.qza. That exact same samplesheet.tsv is imported here and slightly changed to make it phyloseq friendly. In this example, all relevant Qiime2 outputs were copied into a folder named ‘qiimefiles’. # Sample sheet metadata &lt;- read_tsv(&quot;qiimefiles/samplesheet.tsv&quot;) # lets call the R object &#39;metadata&#39; to reflect its purpose # Inspect the metadata object. The second row is qiime-specific information and has to be removed. metadata2 &lt;- metadata[c(2:nrow(metadata)),] %&gt;% # remove the top row and convert characters to factors rownames_to_column(&quot;spl&quot;)%&gt;% # this just adds the rownames to a column and calles in &quot;spl&quot; mutate_all(type.convert) %&gt;% mutate_if(is.factor, as.character) %&gt;% # reformatting columns to avoid any problems with factors at this stage column_to_rownames(&quot;spl&quot;) %&gt;% # this puts the column &quot;spl&quot; back into rownames as_tibble() %&gt;% column_to_rownames(&quot;#SampleID&quot;) # str(metadata2) # use the `str` command to inspect the data # Then decide which of the columns you want to be factors and in which order these factors should go. This will determine the order in which ggplot will plot them. You can include the levels = c(&quot;level1&quot;, &quot;level&quot;...) command to determine the order, which is not done here. metadata2 &lt;- metadata2 %&gt;% mutate(Reactor = factor(Reactor)) %&gt;% # replace column Reactor with the same values but made a factor. mutate(Location = factor(loc)) # create a new column &#39;Location&#39;, which is a factor of &#39;loc&#39; # Qiime import SVs &lt;- qiime2R::read_qza(&quot;qiimefiles/featuretable-insertiontree-filtered.qza&quot;) ASVtable &lt;- as.data.frame(SVs$data) # extract the data table, this has to be a dataframe # Taxonomy taxonomy &lt;- qiime2R::read_qza(&quot;qiimefiles/taxonomy_silva.qza&quot;) # import the qiime object taxonomy &lt;- taxonomy$data # extract the taxonomy data ## re-format the taxonomy file to split the taxonomy into columns ## remove the confidence column taxtable &lt;- taxonomy %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% separate(Taxon, sep=&quot;;&quot;, c(&quot;Kingdom&quot;,&quot;Phylum&quot;,&quot;Class&quot;,&quot;Order&quot;,&quot;Family&quot;,&quot;Genus&quot;,&quot;Species&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(-Confidence) %&gt;% column_to_rownames(&quot;Feature.ID&quot;) %&gt;% as.matrix() # Tree tree &lt;- read_qza(&quot;qiimefiles/insertion-tree.qza&quot;) tree &lt;- tree$data #extract data # Create the phyloseq object ps &lt;-phyloseq( otu_table(ASVtable, taxa_are_rows = T), sample_data(metadata2), phyloseq::tax_table(taxtable), phyloseq::phy_tree(tree) ) # ps (not run) # phyloseq-class experiment-level object # otu_table() OTU Table: [ 4218 taxa and 51 samples ] # sample_data() Sample Data: [ 51 samples by 14 sample variables ] # tax_table() Taxonomy Table: [ 4218 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ] # phy_tree() Phylogenetic Tree: [ 4218 tips and 4217 internal nodes ] # remove things out of the R environment you dont need. rm(metadata, metadata2, SVs, taxonomy, taxtable, tree, ASVtable) ## Remove those annoying short codes in front of taxa names (i.e. p__ etc) as they ## dont look good in visualisation tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Kingdom&quot;] &lt;- str_replace_all(tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Kingdom&quot;], &quot;d__&quot;, &quot;&quot;) tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Phylum&quot;] &lt;- str_replace_all(tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Phylum&quot;], &quot; p__&quot;, &quot;&quot;) tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Class&quot;] &lt;- str_replace_all(tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Class&quot;], &quot; c__&quot;, &quot;&quot;) tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Order&quot;] &lt;- str_replace_all(tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Order&quot;], &quot; o__&quot;, &quot;&quot;) tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Family&quot;] &lt;- str_replace_all(tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Family&quot;], &quot; f__&quot;, &quot;&quot;) tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Genus&quot;] &lt;- str_replace_all(tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Genus&quot;], &quot; g__&quot;, &quot;&quot;) tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Species&quot;] &lt;- str_replace_all(tax_table(ps)[, &quot;Species&quot;], &quot; s__&quot;, &quot;&quot;) From the output of the ps object we can see that there are 4281 ASVs in 51 samples and associated with 14 variables in the metadata. If you wish, you can access each individual data set from the ps object with functions otu_table(ps)@.Data, sample_data(ps) tax_table(ps)@.Data or phy_tree(ps). This can become handy if you want to change something, such as adding columns to the sample_data or changing them to a factor etc.. ASVs &lt;- otu_table(ps)@.Data metadata &lt;- data.frame(sample_data(ps)) taxtable &lt;- data.frame(tax_table(ps)@.Data) tree &lt;- phy_tree(ps) # Inspect individual objects in your own time. 5.2.3 Save the ps object as an .rds file into your working directory Optional This step allows you to save and store the R object as a RDS file and load it back into any future R environment, should you require it. This would be helpful if your workflow is separated into different Rscripts and you want to just load in the RDS file instead of having to import qiime files and create the phyloseq object every time. saveRDS(ps, file = &quot;ps_ProjectX_2022July&quot;) # to load the file back into your R environment: # ps &lt;- readRDS(file = &quot;ps_ProjectX_2022July&quot;) 5.2.4 Initial filtering Keep the orginal ps object unchanged. Create new objects for subsequent filtering steps. Often we simply filter out any ASVs that have less than x number of reads and are present in less than x number of samples. This helps to reduce noise and the overload of zeros in the dataset, which some differential abundance tests can’t deal with. Perhaps, it also helps with removing ASVs that were incorrectly denoised with DADA2 in the first place. However, it also means that rare ASVs with a low prevalence are not considered. So filtering has to be done with consideration to the intended analysis. Then filter out any phyla that came up as uncharacterized and taxa that came up as mitochondria and chloroplast. # filter as needed. This will be your final otu-table. # Although you can still filter for specific analysis if needed. # minimum of reads per feature ps.flt = prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps) &gt;= 5, ps) #minimum reads per feature # ps.flt (not run) # phyloseq-class experiment-level object # otu_table() OTU Table: [ 3911 taxa and 51 samples ] # sample_data() Sample Data: [ 51 samples by 14 sample variables ] # tax_table() Taxonomy Table: [ 3911 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ] # phy_tree() Phylogenetic Tree: [ 3911 tips and 1694 internal nodes ] #filter any &quot;NA&quot;-phyla that have not been classified i.e. # contain nothing in the phylum column of the taxtable (just a &lt;NA&gt;) ps.flt = subset_taxa(ps.flt , !is.na(Phylum) &amp; !Phylum %in% c(&quot;&quot;)) # ps.flt (not run) # phyloseq-class experiment-level object # otu_table() OTU Table: [ 3892 taxa and 51 samples ] # sample_data() Sample Data: [ 51 samples by 14 sample variables ] # tax_table() Taxonomy Table: [ 3892 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ] # phy_tree() Phylogenetic Tree: [ 3892 tips and 1687 internal nodes ] # Filter out non-bacteria, mitochondia and chloroplast taxa ps.flt &lt;- ps.flt %&gt;% subset_taxa(Kingdom == &quot;Bacteria&quot; &amp; Family != &quot;Mitochondria&quot; &amp; Class != &quot;Chloroplast&quot;) # ps.flt (not run) # phyloseq-class experiment-level object # otu_table() OTU Table: [ 3853 taxa and 51 samples ] # sample_data() Sample Data: [ 51 samples by 14 sample variables ] # tax_table() Taxonomy Table: [ 3853 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ] # phy_tree() Phylogenetic Tree: [ 3853 tips and 1673 internal nodes ] # We can filter more for running beta diversity or differential abundance analysis later. This will be shown in later chapters # For example: # minimum presence in x% of samples (51 * 0.04 = 2 samples) # ps.flt = filter_taxa(ps.flt, function(x) sum(x &gt; 0) &gt; (0.04*length(x)), TRUE) # Would result in # phyloseq-class experiment-level object # otu_table() OTU Table: [ 1674 taxa and 51 samples ] # sample_data() Sample Data: [ 51 samples by 14 sample variables ] # tax_table() Taxonomy Table: [ 1674 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ] # phy_tree() Phylogenetic Tree: [ 1674 tips and 1673 internal nodes ] 5.2.5 Proportion of ASVs identified Check what proportion of ASVs could be identified on phylum and genus-level. This is best done with the handy phyloseq function ntaxa(), which gives the number of taxa present in the phyloseq object. This will indicate how many reads you would be discarding, in case you remove ASVs, which were not assigned a taxon. It is also an indicator of how well the database you have been using (e.g. Silva here) has performed.You could compare that with other databases if you wish. # percent of phyla identified ps.flt = subset_taxa(ps , !is.na(Phylum) &amp; !Phylum %in% c(&quot;&quot;)) # percent of phyla identified ntaxa(ps.flt) / ntaxa(ps) ## [1] 0.9947843 ps.flt = subset_taxa(ps , !is.na(Genus) &amp; !Genus %in% c(&quot;&quot;)) # percent of phyla identified ntaxa(ps.flt) / ntaxa(ps) ## [1] 0.940256 5.2.6 Rarefaction curve Check if you cover enough depth for diversity analyses. Some samples may have low species richness, including a negative or samples that failed during PCR for example. The rarefaction curve will help assess which samples you may have to exclude from subsequent diversity calculations. It also provides a general view if samples cover enough of the potential richness (Number of ASVs). The curve shows you the number of ‘Species’ (i.e. ASVs) on the y axis and the total reads on the x axis for each sample. So basically, it shows how rich each sample is and indicates if the number of reads that are captured in a samples covers enough of the ASVs. If the curve flattens, it indicates that the sample would not get any richer even with more reads… I typically use the rarefaction curve to check if there are samples that need removing before establishing alpha diversity metrics. In this example, the vertical line helps identify the sample with lowest number of reads. We can check that by running min(colSums(otu_table(ps.flt))), which tells us that they are 9690 reads in the sample with lowest reads. If this sample is kept in and we measure subsequent alpha diversity metrics, where each of the sample-reads are randomly resampled to the lowest read-number (here 9690), then we may not capture the diversity of samples with higher richness. The grey horizontal lines indicate how much richness we may lose if we include the sample with lowest number of reads (the difference between grey horizontal line and the curve of each sample at the highest number of reads on x-axis). vegan::rarecurve(t(otu_table(ps.flt)), step=200, sample = min(colSums(otu_table(ps.flt))), label = FALSE, xlab = &quot;Sample Size after filtering&quot;) # show the lowest and highest number of sample reads. max(colSums(otu_table(ps.flt))) ## [1] 41342 min(colSums(otu_table(ps.flt))) ## [1] 9726 # Filtering options # filter options (not run), you can filter out specific sample or treatments from the phyloseq objects. # `%notin%` = Negate(`%in%`) # create a %notin% filter operator for filtering # Filtering out treatments, e.g. any sample that was labeled &quot;Negative&quot; in the metadata # ps.flt.flt &lt;- prune_samples(sample_data(ps.flt)$Treatment %notin% c(&quot;Negative&quot;), ps.flt) # Filtering out any taxa that have zero reads because they were only present in the removed samples. # ps.flt.flt &lt;- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps.flt.flt) != 0, ps.flt.flt) Once you identified the samples you would like to remove (e.g. samples with too few reads), you can filter out these specific samples or treatments from the phyloseq objects. For example, with the prune_samples(sample_data(ps.flt)$Treatment %notin% c(\"Negative\"), ps.flt) command here we would sample out any samples labeled as “Negative” in the metadata. Afterwards make sure to sample out any taxa that now contain zero reads because they were only present in the removed samples. Perhaps, create new phyloseq objects to differentiate from your different filtered object ps.flt.flt &lt;- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps.flt) != 0, ps.flt). See also Chapter 7 where the phyloseq object is pre-filtered before ggplotting. In this example, we are keeping the sample with lowest reads. No further filtering required at this stage. 5.2.7 Prevalence table Create a prevalence table to get an overview of phyla with low to high prevalence. The output is a dataframe showing all phyla in order of total abundance. The mean prevalence defines how often the phylum appears across all samples on average. E.g. a mean prevalence of 10.22 means that ASVs in this phylum were present on average in 10.22 samples. Higher values indicates a ‘core’ relevance to the sum of samples. This table is handy to decide if you want to remove certain phyla from some visualisations as they may not contribute to the overall analysis. It also allows for a comparison with filtered and unfiltered data for due diligence. Here it is apparent that phyla that were unclassified (i.e.  ) contributed 3,522 reads to the total of 1,299,791 reads. That is 3522 / sum(phyloseq::otu_table(ps)) * 100 = 0.27%. Chances are that these NA sequences may just be noise and may not represent biological relevant amplicons. Hence, I would keep them out of any further analysis. However, in environments where you get higher contributions of unknown amplicons, it may indicate that the taxonomic database does not capture your samples well. In that case it would be wise to keep the NAs in for measuring alpha and beta diversity. ## Create a prevalence table to see which phyla have low prevalence #ps.flt.prev &lt;- prune_samples(sample_data(physeqB.flt)$Treatment != &quot;Reference&quot;, physeqB.flt) # ps.flt.prevtab &lt;- prune_samples(sample_data(physeqB.flt.prevtab)$Treatment != &quot;Blank&quot;, physeqB.flt.prevtab) prevelancedf = apply(X = phyloseq::otu_table(ps.flt), MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x){sum(x &gt;

"],["plottingdiversity.html", "Chapter 6 Plotting diversity 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Workflow", " Chapter 6 Plotting diversity Some visualisations of alpha and beta diversity. 6.1 Introduction This chapter introduces you to a basic workflow for plotting alpha and beta diversity using phyloseq and ggplot. It provides examples for loading the phyloseq object from a previously saved .rds file, then how to calculate and include alpha diversity metrics into the sample_data of the phyloseq object, and finally how to plot some of these metrics, individually or combined. Furthermore, beta diversity, i.e. four different type of ordinations are plotted. The examples, include non-metric dimensional scaling on Bray-Curtis dissimilaries, Principal Component Analysis (Aitchison distance), Redundancy Analysis ( Aitchison) and a Principal Coordinate Analysis on unweighted uniFrac distances. The stats behind the individual metrics are not discussed. If you want to learn more about the various options to analyse your amplicon-derived diversity, perhaps start here: https://sites.google.com/site/mb3gustame/home, the GUide to STatistical Analysis in Microbial Ecology (GUSTA ME). This is one of many other useful links and resources. Some others are listed in chapter 2 under “Workflows from other lab groups”. As mentioned in Chapter 2, prior to establishing alpha diversity indices, as well as Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, we will stick to rarefying sequences to a specific library size (library size = sum of sequence counts of a sample) to normalise the data and prevent bias due to library size. Usually, this is done using the smallest library size of all samples. If you want to learn more about rarefying - this paper explains the process: Enhancing diversity analysis by repeatedly rarefying next generation sequencing data describing microbial communities (Cameron et al. (2021)). We will follow the recommendations from the authors of this paper to resample without replacement. Note that rarefying is generally not recommended for statistical inferences in differential abundance analyses due to the loss of statistical power. Learn why here: Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data Is Inadmissible (McMurdie and Holmes (2014)). Other normalisation methods (see Chapter 2) are also possible and it is up to you, the analyst, to understand and decide on the appropriate methods. My preference is to use centred-log ratios (Aitchison distances). Aitchison distances are used in the workflow below for the PCA and RDA. The compositional approach and centred log-ratios are further discussed in the paper Microbiome Datasets Are Compositional: And This Is Not Optional (Gloor et al. (2017)). In fact, comparing the results after applying different types of normalisation methods, dissimilarities or distances may complement your analysis and help in interpretation of data. 6.1.1 Required files A phyloseq object; either read in from a pre-saved .rds file or created as described in chapter 5 under “Import qiime-files and create a phyloseq object”.

First, the abundances are pre-filtered (as shown in the previous chapter), then the ASV abundances are randomly resampled with phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth, such that all samples have the same number of ASVs. The diversity indices are then calculated with phyloseq::estimate_richness based on these evenly resampled abundances.

There are different packages that help to create a names color vector. Here we use the package colorspace. A handy color cheat sheet is available here: https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf First create a vector of all possible taxonomic names that could be included in your ggplot. For example, if you plan to plot on phylum-level then all phyla names are extracted from the phyloseq object and then those names are given a color code. The colors are defined as hex color codes. # You can check Hex codes with help of https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ # https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf # For all possible phyla names phylum_data &lt;- microbiome::aggregate_taxa(ps, &quot;Phylum&quot;) # aggregate data to phylum level # the pacakage &#39;microbiome&#39; has some handy helper functions such as `aggregate`. names &lt;- rownames(phylum_data@tax_table) # extract a vector of phylum names using `rownames` # Package colorspace library(colorspace) cols &lt;- colorspace::rainbow_hcl(length(names)) # this creates x number of hex codes. x = `length(names)`. # in this case there are 48 phyla, hence we get 48 hex codes. names(cols) &lt;- names # name each hex code with phyla names. # Option to use the package viridis #library(viridis) # cols &lt;- viridis::turbo(length(names), direction = -1) # names(cols) &lt;- names # Option to use the package RColorBrewer # library(RColorBrewer) # display.brewer.all(length(names)) # check colour themes available in the RColorBrewer package # cols &lt;- brewer.pal(length(names), &#39;RdYlBu&#39;) # cols &lt;- rainbow_hcl(length(names)) # names(cols) &lt;- names cols # check content of the color vector ## Acetothermia Acidobacteriota ## &quot;#E495A5&quot; &quot;#E3979D&quot; ## Actinobacteriota Armatimonadota ## &quot;#E19995&quot; &quot;#DE9B8D&quot; ## Bacteroidota Bdellovibrionota ## &quot;#DB9D85&quot; &quot;#D79F7E&quot; ## Caldatribacteriota Caldisericota ## &quot;#D2A277&quot; &quot;#CDA471&quot; ## Campilobacterota Chloroflexi ## &quot;#C7A76C&quot; &quot;#C1A968&quot; ## CK-2C2-2 Cloacimonadota ## &quot;#BAAC65&quot; &quot;#B3AE64&quot; ## Coprothermobacterota Cyanobacteria ## &quot;#ABB065&quot; &quot;#A2B367&quot; ## Deinococcota Dependentiae ## &quot;#99B56B&quot; &quot;#90B66F&quot; ## Desulfobacterota Elusimicrobiota ## &quot;#86B875&quot; &quot;#7CBA7C&quot; ## FCPU426 Fermentibacterota ## &quot;#72BB83&quot; &quot;#67BC8A&quot; ## Fibrobacterota Firmicutes ## &quot;#5CBD92&quot; &quot;#51BE9A&quot; ## Fusobacteriota Gemmatimonadota ## &quot;#47BEA2&quot; &quot;#3FBEA9&quot; ## Hydrogenedentes Hydrothermae ## &quot;#39BEB1&quot; &quot;#37BDB8&quot; ## Latescibacterota Margulisbacteria ## &quot;#3BBCBF&quot; &quot;#42BBC6&quot; ## Marinimicrobia_(SAR406_clade) MBNT15 ## &quot;#4CB9CC&quot; &quot;#57B8D1&quot; ## Methylomirabilota Myxococcota ## &quot;#64B5D6&quot; &quot;#70B3DA&quot; ## Nitrospirota Patescibacteria ## &quot;#7DB0DD&quot; &quot;#8AADE0&quot; ## Planctomycetota Proteobacteria ## &quot;#96AAE1&quot; &quot;#A1A7E2&quot; ## SAR324_clade(Marine_group_B) Spirochaetota ## &quot;#ACA4E2&quot; &quot;#B5A1E1&quot; ## Sumerlaeota Sva0485 ## &quot;#BE9EDF&quot; &quot;#C69BDC&quot; ## Synergistota Thermotogota ## &quot;#CD99D8&quot; &quot;#D497D4&quot; ## Verrucomicrobiota WPS-2 ## &quot;#D995CF&quot; &quot;#DD94C9&quot; ## WS1 WS4 ## &quot;#E093C3&quot; &quot;#E293BC&quot; ## Zixibacteria Unknown ## &quot;#E493B4&quot; &quot;#E494AD&quot; 7.2.5 Pre-filtering Some arbitrary quality filtering of individual ASVs. For example, here we choose to remove ASVs that have very few reads (i.e. less than 5 counts). Use the prune_taxa() function from phyloseq to filter taxa or the prune_samples() function to filter selected samples. ps_flt &lt;- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps) &gt;= 5, ps) #minimum reads per feature #ps_flt # phyloseq-class experiment-level object # otu_table() OTU Table: [ 3911 taxa and 51 samples ] # sample_data() Sample Data: [ 51 samples by 15 sample variables ] # tax_table() Taxonomy Table: [ 3911 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ] # phy_tree() Phylogenetic Tree: [ 3911 tips and 3910 internal nodes ] # Use `prune_samples()` If you need to filter data to a subset of samples. # E.g. choose samples of reactor 1A only ps_flt_1A &lt;- prune_samples(sample_data(ps_flt)$Reactor == &quot;1A&quot;, ps_flt) # Use `prune_taxa` to remove any ASVs/taxa that are now zero # (i.e. are not present in reactor 1A). # In other words we keep only those ASVs/Taxa that are present in the filtered samples. ps_flt_1A &lt;- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps_flt_1A) &gt; 0, ps_flt_1A) #phyloseq-class experiment-level object #otu_table() OTU Table: [ 420 taxa and 2 samples ] #sample_data() Sample Data: [ 2 samples by 15 sample variables ] #tax_table() Taxonomy Table: [ 420 taxa by 7 taxonomic ranks ] #phy_tree() Phylogenetic Tree: [ 420 tips and 419 internal nodes ] 7.2.6 Analysis and plotting Create stacked barplot comparing relative abundances of the normalised phyloseq object. First abundances are aggregated to phylum level and then transformed into relative abundances. This is followed by the creation of a long-form abundance table that includes metadata with help of the very handy psmelt function from the phyloseq package. The function psmelt takes a phyloseq object and extracts abundances and related metadata into a dataframe for plotting. Finally, the abundances of this long abundance table are summarised into the factors that you want to compare. In this example, abundances of different Locations are compared, hence the column Location will be summarised and plotted. # Phylum plot # First, create a long abundance data table taxa_data &lt;- microbiome::aggregate_taxa(ps_flt, &quot;Phylum&quot;) %&gt;% # aggregate abundances to phylum-level microbiome::transform(., &quot;compositional&quot;) %&gt;% # transform abundance to relative abundances phyloseq::psmelt(.) # extract long abundance table with metadata for plotting. # Note: The `.` replaces the phyloseq object. # This is because the functions are piped into a sequence by using the `%&gt;%` operator. # The `%&gt;%` operator is a Tidyverse function and is very helpful in putting # various different operations and changes to the data into one sequence. # We could have put the below operations into the same above sequence too. # There is no difference in the outcome. # Summarise abundances by columns of your choice containing factors. # E.g. compute the mean abundances based on the columns `Location`, `Reactor` and `Phylum. taxa_data &lt;- taxa_data %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(Location, Reactor, Phylum) %&gt;% # group by Location and Phylum to summarise data dplyr::summarise(Meanabu = mean(Abundance)) %&gt;% # Create a column called `Meanabu` dplyr::filter(Meanabu &gt; 0) %&gt;% # filter out rows that have 0 abundance dplyr::arrange(desc(Meanabu)) # sort the abundances # Now, create a vector with phylum names that will determine the order of # phylum names in the stacked barcharts. order &lt;- taxa_data$Phylum %&gt;% unique() # Phylum names need to be factors for plotting. # This is the final dataframe for plotting taxa_data$Phylum &lt;- factor(taxa_data$Phylum, levels = order) # # Check out the first few rows head(taxa_data) ## # A tibble: 6 × 4 ## # Groups: Location, Reactor [6] ## Location Reactor Phylum Meanabu ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Avedoere RT1 Chloroflexi 0.279 ## 2 Slagelse RT2 Proteobacteria 0.278 ## 3 Esbjerg Vest 1B Chloroflexi 0.256 ## 4 Avedoere RT2 Chloroflexi 0.251 ## 5 Esbjerg Vest 2B Chloroflexi 0.243 ## 6 Esbjerg Vest RT2B Firmicutes 0.236 # Finally its time to create a ggplot. taxaplot &lt;- taxa_data %&gt;% ggbarplot( x= &quot;Reactor&quot;, y = &quot;Meanabu&quot;, fill = &quot;Phylum&quot;, position = position_stack(), legend = &quot;right&quot;, ylab = &quot;Relative Abundances&quot;) + # Tell ggplot to use the `cols` vector created earlier # only the first 20 colors are shown in legend, hence the `order[1:20]` scale_fill_manual(values = cols, limits = order[1:20]) + facet_grid(cols = vars(Location), # create facets by factors in column `Location`. scales = &quot;free_x&quot;, space = &quot;free_x&quot;) + guides(fill = guide_legend(byrow = FALSE)) + rotate_x_text(angle = 45) + # rotate the x-axis labels theme_bw() + # makes ggplots look better theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), # remove the background grid panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) taxaplot 7.2.7 Prevalance table A prevalence table may assist in getting an overview of the abundances. The mean prevalence is the average number of times that the taxon appears across all samples. prevalancedf = apply(X = phyloseq::otu_table(ps_flt), MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x){sum(x &gt; 0)}) prevalancedf = data.frame(Prevalence = prevalancedf, TotalAbundance = phyloseq::taxa_sums(ps_flt), phyloseq::tax_table(ps_flt)) prevalancedf &lt;- plyr::ddply(prevalancedf, &quot;Phylum&quot;, function(df1){ data.frame(mean_prevalence=mean(df1$Prevalence), total_abundance=sum(df1$TotalAbundance, na.rm = T), stringsAsFactors = F) }) # print table from highest to lowest abundance prevalancedf %&gt;% arrange(desc(total_abundance)) ## Phylum mean_prevalence total_abundance ## 1 Chloroflexi 5.124069 228197 ## 2 Bacteroidota 4.688679 201921 ## 3 Firmicutes 4.453435 197683 ## 4 Actinobacteriota 5.231343 165740 ## 5 Proteobacteria 4.249147 161756 ## 6 Desulfobacterota 5.425743 57146 ## 7 Synergistota 6.595506 51225 ## 8 Cloacimonadota 6.500000 45294 ## 9 Acidobacteriota 3.953488 35304 ## 10 Thermotogota 10.190476 33489 ## 11 Spirochaetota 4.578431 25015 ## 12 Verrucomicrobiota 3.382022 16598 ## 13 Fermentibacterota 35.000000 14812 ## 14 Patescibacteria 3.669173 14399 ## 15 Caldatribacteriota 5.500000 8932 ## 16 Planctomycetota 2.573171 5455 ## 17 Armatimonadota 2.933333 4443 ## 18 Marinimicrobia_(SAR406_clade) 20.000000 3818 ## 19 &lt;NA&gt; 4.052632 3511 ## 20 Hydrogenedentes 3.950000 3411 ## 21 Nitrospirota 8.750000 2853 ## 22 Campilobacterota 4.187500 2710 ## 23 SAR324_clade(Marine_group_B) 4.000000 2616 ## 24 WS1 3.625000 2559 ## 25 Fibrobacterota 2.826087 1938 ## 26 Myxococcota 3.176471 1353 ## 27 Bdellovibrionota 3.600000 1111 ## 28 Caldisericota 3.818182 1067 ## 29 WPS-2 2.666667 897 ## 30 Sumerlaeota 3.888889 683 ## 31 Cyanobacteria 9.000000 647 ## 32 Fusobacteriota 2.888889 565 ## 33 Coprothermobacterota 2.800000 511 ## 34 Gemmatimonadota 2.875000 300 ## 35 Elusimicrobiota 2.833333 225 ## 36 CK-2C2-2 4.000000 162 ## 37 Methylomirabilota 4.000000 159 ## 38 Latescibacterota 2.333333 86 ## 39 Dependentiae 2.500000 78 ## 40 Zixibacteria 5.000000 74 ## 41 Sva0485 2.333333 66 ## 42 Acetothermia 2.000000 59 ## 43 WS4 1.500000 39 ## 44 Hydrothermae 1.000000 26 ## 45 Deinococcota 1.000000 11 "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
